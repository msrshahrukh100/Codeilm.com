> A webpack loader that moves a module and its dependencies into a Web Worker, automatically reflecting exported functions as asynchronous proxies.

- Bundles a tiny, purpose-built RPC implementation into your app
- If exported module methods are already async, signature is unchanged
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous worker functions
- Works beautifully with async/await
- Imported value is instantiable, just a decorated `Worker`


## Install

```sh
npm install -D workerize-loader
```


### Usage

**worker.js**:

```js
// block for `time` ms, then return the number of loops we could run in that time:
export function expensive(time) {
    let start = Date.now(),
        count = 0
    while (Date.now() - start < time) count++
    return count
}
```

**index.js**: _(our demo)_

```js
import worker from 'workerize-loader!./worker'

let instance = worker()  // `new` is optional

instance.expensive(1000).then( count => {
    console.log(`Ran ${count} loops`)
})
```

### Options

#### `inline`

Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

You can also inline the worker as a BLOB with the `inline` parameter

```js
// webpack.config.js
{
  loader: 'workerize-loader',
  options: { inline: true }
}
```
or 
```js
import worker from 'workerize-loader?inline!./worker'
```

### About [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)

If you're using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) in your build, make sure you disabled commonJS transform. Otherwize, workerize-loader won't be able to retrieve the list of exported function from your worker script :
```js
{
    test: /\.js$/,
    loader: "babel-loader",
    options: {
        presets: [
            [
                "env",
                {
                    modules: false,
                },
            ],
        ]
    }
}
```
