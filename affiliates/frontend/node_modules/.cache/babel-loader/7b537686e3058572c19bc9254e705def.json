If it\n * is a rule, that rule is pushed onto the stack and the parsing continues from\n * that point.\n *\n * If it is a terminal description, the token is checked against it using a\n * `match` function. If the match is successful, the token is colored and the\n * rule is stepped forward. If the match is unsuccessful, the remainder of the\n * rule is skipped and the previous rule is advanced.\n *\n * This parsing algorithm allows for incremental online parsing within various\n * levels of the syntax tree and results in a structured `state` linked-list\n * which contains the relevant information to produce valuable typeaheads.\n */\n\n/**\n *  Copyright (c) 2015, Facebook, Inc.\n *  All rights reserved.\n *\n *  This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n *  LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
